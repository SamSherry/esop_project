Instructions for downloading announcements from SIRCA

1.	Go to SIRCA OneLogin and enter your email address and password: https://sirca.onelogin.com/login 

2.	You will have a choice to enter either the SIRCA Gateway or the SIRCA Data Library.
The SIRCA Data Library contains the Australian Company Announcements (ACA) Library headline summaries file, as well as the SPPR database.
The announcements themselves are accessed from the SIRCA Gateway.

3.	SIRCA has created a number of standard notebooks, which use a Python script to extract the data you want. 
The script for downloading announcements is called “SIRCA_ACA_SIMPLE_EXTRACTION”. See GitHub code.

4.	Suggest creating a folder for each company and saving the downloaded announcements for that company to its folder.
